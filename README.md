# Johnny Reb Contract

Johnny Reb is simply a Smart Contract Splitter for dev fees for the team working together to token gate online communities. We believe that these "Blockchain Clubs" are best mobilized when they first have a token of membership. That token or series of tokens on multiple Blockchains and Layer-2's allows for wide and diverse access to the club with a vibrant community.

Our team works alongside these communities to build the brand identity, web app for online presence, and the tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) needed to grow the community. Where we really add value is through advising the Tokenomics and launch strategy to maximize expansion of the community.

## Why this name?

We understand the name [Johnny Reb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Reb) may be a somewhat controversial in today's culture, but we are American history buffs and believe the Civil War era mentality is similar in ways to the rebel spirit of Blockchain project founders. Founders are fighting to establish a decentralized community outside government control and against the much larger economic establishment of Web2 ([Billy Yank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Yank)). We don't want to draw the parallels between the time periods more than that, but it is a good generic term in our minds for our decentralized group of rebel builders on the Blockchain.
